## Background
This app presents data from a question from the World Values Survey (one of the oldest cross-national social surveys in the world) that asks: Are you a member of the following association: sports, arts, labor, politics, environment, women's rights, human rights, charity, or other.

Looking at the degree to which an individual participates in organizations outside of family and work has been one measure of civic participation in the literature.

The App aims to contribute to the study of civic participation. It provides some exploratory analyses and examines the data by gender and education attainment.
