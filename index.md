## The question

Civic participation is seen as a cornerstone of democracy in fields of political science, sociology, and education. One way to measure civic participation is looking at the degree to which an individual participates in organizations outside of family and work. Such organizations or associations are often the foundation to social capital and network. 

This app presents data from a question from the World Values Survey (one of the oldest cross-national social surveys in the world) that asks: Are you a member of the following association: sports, arts, labor, politics, environment, women's rights, human rights, charity, or other.

The analyses examine the data by gender and education attainment breakdown as those two criteria are relevant characteristcs to civic participation.
